Querying eT results data files from the Data Catalog. It uses query_eT to associate the files to test. Because the database is 
behind the SLAC firewall, this needs to be run at SLAC.Until the eTraveler python api is updated to include this.

Get findCCD from github

It needs a datacat module

setenv PYTHONPATH /u/ey/richard/LSST/eT/datacat/0.4/lib/

Also copy over /u/ey/richard/LSST/eT/DataCatalog.py into your python path

 You can find examples of the (previous rendition's) use here:

 Note that needing the eTraveler root traveler name (eg SR-EOT-1) is new to those instructions.
