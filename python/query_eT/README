Querying eT results database and plotting sensor analysis results. Because the database is behind the SLAC firewall, 
this needs to be run at SLAC.Until the eTraveler python api is updated to include this.

Get query_eT from github

Copy setup.sh to your directory and source it to set up the path to the needed python install (need sqlalchemy and mysql):

setenv PATH /nfs/farm/g/lsst/u1/software/redhat6-x86_64-64bit-gcc44/anaconda/2.5.0/bin:$PATH

Copy db_connect.txt for the database information (kept separate from the script)
